**Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Cloud Banking**
**Introduction**

This code implements a client-server application demonstrating homomorphic encryption for secure cloud banking operations. It utilizes the LightPHE library to perform homomorphic addition on encrypted user balances stored in a MongoDB database.

**Key Features**

* **Client-side encryption:** User balances are encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud, ensuring data privacy.
* **Homomorphic addition:** The cloud server can perform addition operations on encrypted balances without decrypting them.
* **Client-side decryption:** The encrypted sum is sent back to the client for decryption using their private key.
* **MongoDB integration:** Encrypted user data (NID and balance) is stored in a MongoDB database.

**Dependencies**

* LightPHE (homomorphic encryption library): `pip install lightphe`
* pymongo (MongoDB driver): `pip install pymongo`

**Installation**

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install lightphe pymongo
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and create a database and collection for storing encrypted user data.

**Usage**

**1. Client-Side Encryption:**

   - Generate a key pair using the Exponential-ElGamal algorithm (modify if needed):

     ```python
     cs = LightPHE(algorithm_name="Exponential-ElGamal")
     cs.export_keys(target_file="public.txt", public=True)  # Export public key
     cs.export_keys(target_file="private.txt", public=False)  # Export private key
     ```

   - Replace `userNID` and `balance` with actual user data.
   - Encrypt user NIDs and balances using the `cs.encrypt` method.

**2. Cloud Server Operation:**

   - Restore data from the database using the public key (`public.txt`).
   - Decrypt the retrieved ciphertexts (commented out for security):

     ```python
     # print('User balance:')
     # print(cs.decrypt(doc['balance']).value)
     ```

   - Perform homomorphic addition on the encrypted balances using the `+` operator.

**3. Client-Side Decryption of the Sum:**

   - Decrypt the encrypted sum received from the cloud server using the private key (`private.txt`).

**Limitations**

* **Performance:** Homomorphic encryption operations can be computationally expensive, especially for complex calculations.
* **Noise accumulation:** Repeated homomorphic operations can introduce noise into the encrypted data, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. This can be mitigated by specific homomorphic encryption schemes.
* **Security considerations:** Ensure proper key management and secure communication channels to maintain data privacy and integrity.

**Additional Notes**

* This code provides a basic example of homomorphic encryption for cloud banking. Further development may be required for real-world applications.
* Consider using a more efficient homomorphic encryption scheme depending on the specific needs of your application.
* Explore techniques to mitigate noise accumulation if repeated homomorphic operations are necessary.
